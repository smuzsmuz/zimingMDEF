# Documentation Design

I choose Gitbook as  my website because it is easy for me to write and organize.

I tried to use notion, but it has so many functions and I felt overwhelmed in Notion page. So keeping everything simple is my peference, which I can focus more on the content. I like visualization while I'm editing my website, so coding was not a choice for me neither.

Although Gitbook has many limitations, for example, we cannot change the text font, or create different alignment but in general it fulfils my need and makes everything simple, so I decided to compromise with its limitation and embrace the convinience by using Gitbook.
