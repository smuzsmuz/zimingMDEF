My prototype: photoSync me

It is a headware connects plants and forehead that I can wear during the time of a bad mood. Using plants as a companion: when the human and the plant is under the sun, we can photosynthesize together and both energy from the human body and plant can communicate to each other, so it will bring healing effect.
