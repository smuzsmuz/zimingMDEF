#### My prototype: photoSync me

It is a headware connects plants and forehead that I can wear during the time of a bad mood. Using plants as a companion: when the human and the plant is under the sun, we can photosynthesize together and both energy from the human body and plant can communicate to each other, so it will bring healing effect.

## Prototype III. Judge, to be judged

For the third prototype, we played detective and subject game, which was to be in two roles of watching someone else and being watched while we performed with our prosthesis

### Being as the Subject&#x20;

#### Name: ReflectMe

This prosthesis is made for social anxiety. I used to be nervous when I socialize too much each day, especially in the environment where is crowed or chaotic, I can be very sensitive to the judgement in collective minds. I had observed that when my health situation is unstable, the social anxiety become more frequent, and I receive fear by being judged.

This prosthesis helps me to detect the level of judgement of the people that I encountered with. The goal is to bring psychological security and transform judgemental energy into my belly through the belly button. Turning the source energy of judgement into confidence by using reflective surfaces.

### Being as the Detective

I followed Max.

I was bad as being a detective, I followed Max quite obviously and he tried to get rid of me by running. I lost him for a few times in the street, but eventually I always found him. I thought maybe he was being nice so he showed himself, or maybe it was just coincidence.

Max was putting red and green stickers on some objects. I found some of the stickers, it was hard to locate every small sticker in a complex background, at the same time I have to be aware of where he was going.

My guess of the stickers is to distinguish the objects as organic and non organic.
