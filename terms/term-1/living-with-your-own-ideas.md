## Prototype I. The better version of me

#### My prototype: photoSync me

It is a headware connects plants and forehead that I can wear during the time of a bad mood. Using plants as a companion: when the human and the plant is under the sun, we can photosynthesize together and both energy from the human body and plant can communicate to each other, so it will bring healing effect.

#### Name: motion chime

I wanted to be a wind chime, so I find everything that would make a pleasant sound to me in the classroom and tie them together to make sound.&#x20;

## Prototype III. Judge, to be judged

For the third prototype, we played detective and subject game, which was to be in two roles of watching someone else and being watched while we performed with our prosthesis

### Being as the Subject&#x20;

#### Name: ReflectMe

This prosthesis is made for social anxiety. I used to be nervous when I socialize too much each day, especially in the environment where is crowed or chaotic, I can be very sensitive to the judgement in collective minds. I had observed that when my health situation is unstable, the social anxiety become more frequent, and I receive fear by being judged.

This prosthesis helps me to detect the level of judgement of the people that I encountered with. The goal is to bring psychological security and transform judgemental energy into my belly through the belly button. Turning the source energy of judgement into confidence by using reflective surfaces.

### Being as the Detective

I followed Max.

I was bad as being a detective, I followed Max quite obviously and he tried to get rid of me by running. I lost him for a few times in the street, but eventually I always found him. I thought maybe he was being nice so he showed himself, or maybe it was just coincidence.

Max was putting red and green stickers on some objects. I found some of the stickers, it was hard to locate every small sticker in a complex background, at the same time I have to be aware of where he was going.

My guess of the stickers is to distinguish the objects as organic and non organic.

Finally I asked Max, he said that green sticker represents things he likes, red stickers represents things he doesn't like.

## Conclusion and Reflection

&#x20;     The practice of creating prosthesis had been a very interesting process. The three themes of "being the best version of yourself", "something you want to be", "to judge, to be judged" inspired me to understand how do I design, and why do I produce these products, and started to ask myself why do I want to be this better version of myself and why do I want to be another object.

&#x20;   From experiencing the better version of myself, which was the prothesis with the plant, I began to realize I would love to work with nature. This object reminded me that whenever I felt chaotic from the city life, being in nature can always encourage me to be grounded, instead of being driven blindly by mass information.&#x20;

&#x20;   The object that I want to be is a wind chime, because the sound a wind chime make is very pleasant to me, and I imagine I can be with pleasant sound anywhere I go. By this experience, I realized sound is very important to me.&#x20;

&#x20;   Finally, the last prothesis (ReflectMe) made me reflect on the transformation of my social ability during my whole life until now, from being a talkative kid into an extremely introverted person and until now I have become moderate where I can mostly adjust my social ability according to my body status and environmental influence. I also appreciate how I want to make this prothesis to make myself comfortable. I had fun while playing the detective game, being as a detective was exciting, although I was showing myself to the subject a lot, but it was a nice practice for my brain to guess what was the subject's purpose.

In addition, all the prothesises from the classmate were facinating to me because everyone expressed how they think and how they make things. I love when most people make their objects every functional,   and in shape.
