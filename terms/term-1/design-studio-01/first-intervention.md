### Reflection

I always feel nervous to show my creation of sound in front of others, especially in the scene that is not relevant specially to music. I have the fear of being judged.

I have mixed feelings whenever I walked into room 301. First is overwhelming from the information we recieve every day; then I feel tired and exhaustion to process the information, including anxious feeling of getting things done and talking to many people; at the same time, there is joy and excitment for the fun discoveries from the class and colleagues and fulfilling of curiosity.

#### Fun discovery :tada:

Comparing to many tasks that we have done in the class so far, I rediscovered that I lose track of time when I do things related to music. I don't complain of too much work, and I focus and enjoy the entire process. It is a confirmation to me that I will keep experiement in music and sound.
