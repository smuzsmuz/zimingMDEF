For this intervention, I work with [Javi](https://javierserraa.gitbook.io/home). We recorded video and sound scape around Barcelona, and used OpenStreetMap to note our feelings and emotions.&#x20;

We divided the areas into energetic zone, relaxed zone, curious zone and anxious zone.

In the map, each point represents one video with the emotion. It is open source, and we planed to collect more data from different people in the Design Dialogue to inlcude more information.&#x20;
