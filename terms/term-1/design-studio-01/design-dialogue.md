# Design Dialogue

Javi and me talked about our third intervention (the sensation map), and also did the experiment on people drawing on paper while looking at the kinetic mandala and listening to two tracks of music (Hard techno and Raggae) to observe different drawing patterns and feelings.

It was very helpful to listen to feedback from different people with different background. We have received an idea that emotion is very difficult to be turned into data, because it is complicated and abstract. In addition, different people might have different feelings when facing the same circumstance, and at different time each people would have many feelings too. So a single map might not represent a percise data since we don't have a general standard toward feelings and emotions.

**`However, this idea leads me to have another idea of representing emotions not like a data, but a graphic of various vibrant colors to visualize the mixuture of feelings.`**

Some people reflected that during listening to the music and looking at mandala, they want to dance instead of drawing. This comment help me to realize that different type of expression exist, where we human use different part of our body/brain to react, so it becomes various forms of expression.&#x20;

I am attracted to mandala pattern, which I believe it represents the subconscious mind of human, and I like to create them during different state of being and observe it.
