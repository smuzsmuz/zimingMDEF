Reflection&#x20;

During this week, I am still getting used to talk with many people. Since I had been working by myself or with smaller group of friends in the past five years, becoming more socialized is consuming more energy for me. I feel a huge shift in not only the environment and culture, but also in my structure of mind and my living habits.&#x20;
