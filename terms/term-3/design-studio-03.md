## Scalability Roadmap

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/road map.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The way my design studio is drifting is through the combination of process of expansion and probing process, which is expanded from the topic of emotion and body sensing and probing in an artistic expression of the message of the importance of connection with our own body.&#x20;

### A Design Vision

**Future society**: my project is targeting to the future of mind evolution which concentrates on the reflection of Self awareness and creativity happening along the journey of self discovery.

**Future of role of designers**: with vision of planning for  individual life path based on interpersonal integration, learning and following the system of nature instead of controlling of mankind

**How the social world would be in the future**: focusing and re-adjusting on the personal life vision, change the society on reconstrucing individual brain wiring, communicty of support in creativity activities

**My professional identity**: Sound art guidance, tattoo 'therapy', content creation based on live life obstacles, experiences of solving difficulties in life

## Reflection

To elaborate on the design vision for my project helps me to clear and reassure my goal and my position for the future society, or the society I expect. Finding like minded community and collaborate together will help enforcing this vision into reality. This process builds more confidence in me. It is necessary to examine my vision with what I am doing from time to time, to keep myself on track (although it doesn't matter if I go off track sometimes).
