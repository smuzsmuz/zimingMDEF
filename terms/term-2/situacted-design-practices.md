Jokkoo collective's intention is clear and straight forward, which in my understanding is to construct a community especially for artists who are foreign to Barcelona but now is based in Barcelona to have a space to perform and show the talents, and also is a platform for creators and people with similar interests to come together.

We collected sounds individually, and then we sampled all of our sounds and made a aollective jam!
