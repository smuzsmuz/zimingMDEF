{% tab title="Initial interest" %}
Carlos brought a strong focus on **healthcare applications**, exploring how technology could enhance well-being and monitor physiological signals. Ziming and I leaned more towards **artistic expression** and **body sensing**, aiming to capture and communicate **emotional responses** through wearable technology. This fusion of perspectives inspired the concept of a device that not only monitors the body but also serves as a form of **self-expression**.

{% tab title="Design Draft" %}
The initial idea began as a **bio-reactive tattoo** designed to reflect bodily changes through color and movement. However, as our exploration deepened, the concept evolved into a more complex **wearable interface** that could integrate both biological sensing and dynamic visual feedback. This shift allowed us to experiment with multiple materials, sensors, and design approaches, leading to a versatile prototype.

{% tab title="Device Detail" %}
The device features two key layers: a **pH-reactive hydrogel** with **Bromothymol Blue** that changes color based on sweat acidity, visualizing the body's pH in real time, and a **ferrofluid microfluidic circuit** that moves in response to **electromagnetic fields** controlled by a **GSR sensor**, reflecting stress and emotional fluctuations.

## Progress divided:

1. **Hydrogel Development:** We experimented with BTB as a pH indicator, testing both **agar-agar** and **sodium alginate** to create a reactive hydrogel. While agar-agar showed good reactivity, it was unstable over time, prone to fracturing, and retained moisture. Sodium alginate, though slower to dry, proved more **stable and transparent**, making it a better option for future iterations.

2. **Ferrofluid Creation:** Producing stable ferrofluid was challenging. We initially used iron oxide but later switched to **metal shavings**, which were more magnetic. The best suspension medium was **hypersaturated saltwater**, which stabilized the ferrofluid and prevented separation. We learned that the ferrofluid must be fully submerged to maintain its integrity.

3. **Circuit and GSR Integration:** We built a circuit using a GSR sensor to detect skin conductivity changes, intending to control electromagnets for ferrofluid movement. However, the GSR sensor provided **overly stable signals**, insufficient to drive the electromagnets effectively. We adapted by creating a **variable intensity circuit** suitable for different sensors or considering a simpler **on/off control** mechanism.

4. **Wearable Design and Molding:** The device was designed to be worn on the neck, with **3D-printed molds** used for silicone casting. Some materials were too fragile, and we found that **thinner silicone walls** improve the electromagnetic response. Adjustments are needed to optimize the mold design, possibly replacing the hydrogel with **liquid-filled capsules** for clearer sweat visualization.
