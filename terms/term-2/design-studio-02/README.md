# Design Studio 02

## A personalized developed design space

The idea of my design space becomes more detailed. It focus on human thought and feeling system, and artistical and philosophical approach of expressing the current personal issue in the society, experimenting using physics and technology.

## About `Ethics`

#### 1. **Ethical Foundations of the Project**

**Meta-ethics:** The project assumes that societal change arises from collective reflection on current social issues. It views goodness as fostering dialogue and understanding among individuals, with an emphasis on addressing neglected values.

**Normative ethics:** The design should follow principles of respect for autonomy and inclusivity, ensuring that audiences remain active participants in the reflection process. It should also prioritize transparency, ethical engagement, and accessibility in the performance.

**Applied ethics:** Consequences should be evaluated based on user empowerment and societal impact. Negative outcomes, such as misunderstandings or exclusion, must be addressed by gathering feedback and revising the project accordingly, ensuring continuous ethical alignment.

#### 2. **Embedding Ethics in Design**

The project embeds ethical values by using live sound performances to engage audiences in reflection on societal issues. Values like inclusivity, empathy, and transparency are incorporated through the design, encouraging dialogue around neglected social problems.

However, deviations can occur due to user interpretations or external influences. To address this, the performance should include adaptive elements that allow for audience feedback, ensuring that the ethical intention remains clear and relevant.

#### 3. **Evaluation and Participation Mechanisms**

To make the design process more collaborative and accountable, feedback mechanisms like audience surveys, post-performance discussions, and involvement of marginalized communities are essential. This ensures that diverse perspectives shape the project and that its impact is continuously assessed, promoting transparency and inclusivity.

#### 4. **Non-Human Agency and Autonomy**

In this project, technology (sound systems, interactive components) has a co-evolving role, but the agency lies with the audience. The audience, alongside the designer, acts as both actants (engaging with the performance) and cognizers (interpreting and applying its message). Responsibility is shared, with the designer facilitating the experience and the audience driving the reflection on societal issues.

This collaborative approach challenges the idea of designer control, positioning both humans and technology as equal participants in fostering societal change.

## Reflection final

After getting feedback from some help, I realize for all of my experiments I am lacking a framework.

I found it hard to make a framework for my concept. Everytime when it comes to summarise and organize work, I don't feel like doing it. Not sure if I am rejecting to do such work or I don't feel necessary to do it. Logically organizing the concept is a very good thing to communicate with other people, but if my body don't feel like doing it, maybe it is not the time yet.
