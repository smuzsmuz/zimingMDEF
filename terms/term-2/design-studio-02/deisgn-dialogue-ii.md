## Reflection

This Design Dialogue I felt calm, and knowing more what to do.&#x20;

I tried to present the information minimal and percise, only talk about what I am focusing on and the most possible ongling projects.&#x20;

Many creative feedbacks coming from the people, it was really nice.

\`need framework for all the experiments

\`using humor in performance

\`electromagnetic spectrum

\`WiFi mapping

my own thoughts: nomadic expression collab.
