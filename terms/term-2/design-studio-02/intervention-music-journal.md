# Intervention: music journal

This time I tried to practice how to communicate through bettern narrative through music and visuals. I wanted to use a more direct storytelling way to record my past intense weak after a fire incident happened at my apartment.

The video is constructed in two parts. Part one describes the nervouse situation during the fire and expressing my moon through music, the second part describes a relaxing moment singing in the mountain.

The comparison of the two scenarios is to show the audience how music and narrative affects our feelings while watching it.&#x20;
