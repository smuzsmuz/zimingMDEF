### me: Start by asking me five thoughtful questions about my project, one at a time, in separate messages. Wait for my response to each question before asking the next one. These questions should aim to uncover important aspects of my project, such as its purpose, audience, uniqueness, impact, and practical details.

ChatGPT: What is the primary purpose or goal of your project, and what specific problem or need does it aim to address?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### me: The primary goal is to understand and express the conflict for self employed young people for being creative and free or sacrifice their own ethic to make a living

chatGPT: That’s a powerful theme. Who do you envision as the main audience for your project, and how do you hope they will engage with or be impacted by it?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### me: i am aiming young people between age 18-35, to engage through interactive performance and conversations

chatGPT: That’s an interesting approach! What makes your project unique compared to other works exploring similar themes, and what aspects do you think will stand out most to your audience?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### me: I want to provoke the faith and strength in people's heart to believe in themselves on what they are doing, and not to be put down by the current society if there is anything that goes against their own ethic

chatGPT: That's a powerful message! What are the key practical elements or resources you need to bring your project to life, and what challenges do you foresee in executing it?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### me: i need a performance space, a way to prmote the idea to attract the audience, the challenge would be if I can send the clear intention in the design of the whole performance

chatGPT: It sounds like a compelling challenge! Crafting a clear intention through the performance design will be crucial. Do you have a specific vision or concept for how you want the performance to unfold, or are you still in the process of shaping it?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### me: i am still shaping it. Based on my answers, create a concise project definition, no longer than 1000 words, written in a friendly and easy-to-understand tone.

chatGPT: Project Definition: **The Creative Struggle: A Journey of Self-Belief**

**Overview**\
This project is a dynamic, interactive performance exploring the conflict faced by self-employed young people trying to balance their creativity and personal ethics with the practical realities of making a living. Through music, visual storytelling, and live conversation, we aim to provoke a deep reflection on the pressures young people face in today’s society, while offering a space for empowerment, self-expression, and connection.

**Purpose and Goal**\
The primary goal is to shed light on the struggles of young people who are pursuing creative careers but are often forced to compromise their values to make ends meet. In today’s world, many creatives are caught between staying true to their passion and making ethical decisions while also needing to earn a living. This project will explore this inner conflict, allowing young people to reflect on their own journeys and discover strength in staying true to themselves.

**Audience**\
The project is primarily aimed at young adults, ages 18-35, who are navigating the challenges of creative self-employment. These individuals may feel torn between their personal ethics and the pressure to conform to societal expectations. By focusing on this group, the project aims to provide a sense of solidarity, inspire self-confidence, and spark thought-provoking conversations. It will resonate particularly with those who have felt the weight of societal pressures while trying to pursue their passion.

**The Experience**\
This isn’t just another talk or lecture. The performance will be an immersive experience combining music, visual storytelling, and interactive conversation. Instead of simply discussing the issues, the project will bring them to life, allowing the audience to feel and engage with the emotions behind the struggle.

* **Music**: Music will play a central role in expressing the emotional depth of the conflict. Whether through original compositions or carefully curated songs, the music will set the tone for each part of the experience, creating a space where the audience can deeply connect to the themes of struggle, resilience, and self-belief.
* **Visual Storytelling**: Visuals, including projections and set designs, will create a unique narrative arc that represents the journey of self-discovery and empowerment. The visuals will help to illustrate the tension between creativity and practicality, ethics and survival, while inspiring the audience to think critically about their own paths.
* **Interactive Conversation**: Throughout the performance, there will be opportunities for the audience to engage, share their stories, and discuss the themes of the performance. These conversations will provide a platform for young people to connect with each other and reflect on their personal experiences, ensuring the project’s message of self-belief and empowerment resonates long after the event.

**Uniqueness**\
What sets this project apart from others is its combination of music, visual storytelling, and interactive performance. While many projects discuss similar themes, this performance will offer an experiential approach that allows young people to feel the emotional journey rather than just hearing about it. The music and visuals will create an atmosphere of empathy and understanding, while the interactive conversations will offer a unique chance to share and reflect collectively.

The blend of creative expression and reflection on societal pressures will make this project stand out in its ability to provoke deep emotions and thoughts. It isn’t just a performance—it’s a space for healing, self-reflection, and a call to stay true to one’s creative path.

**Impact**\
Through this project, the goal is to inspire young people to believe in themselves and stay connected to their core values despite external pressures. The performance is designed to create an emotional impact, encouraging individuals to have faith in their journey, no matter how challenging. By showing that others face similar struggles, the project fosters a sense of community, solidarity, and empowerment.

The emotional experience created through music, visuals, and conversation will serve as a reminder that staying true to one’s ethics is not only possible but powerful. The performance will leave the audience feeling stronger, more confident, and more connected to themselves and each other.

**Practical Needs and Challenges**\
To bring this vision to life, the project will require several key elements:

* **Performance Space**: A venue that can accommodate the interactive and immersive nature of the performance is essential. The space needs to support music, visual projections, and interactive conversation.
* **Promotion**: Attracting the right audience is crucial. The project will need a strong promotional strategy that speaks directly to young creatives. Social media, influencer partnerships, and word-of-mouth campaigns can help generate interest.
* **Clear Design**: The greatest challenge will be ensuring that the design of the performance—combining music, visuals, and conversation—sends a clear and cohesive message. The intention behind each artistic element needs to be intentional and resonate with the audience on an emotional level.

In conclusion, **The Creative Struggle: A Journey of Self-Belief** is more than just a performance. It is a movement, a space for creative souls to come together, reflect on their struggles, and leave with a renewed sense of confidence and strength. By addressing the difficult balance between creativity and practicality, the project seeks to ignite hope and empower young people to stay true to their ethical values and creative passions, no matter the societal challenges they face.
