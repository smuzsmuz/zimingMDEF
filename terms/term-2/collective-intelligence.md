### Value

Value is what we hold toward our surround world in everyday life.&#x20;

It was an engaging acitivity to move around in the classroom and talk to each other about our own value. For me, this activity was about fluidity, which created a flexible exchange of value within the classroom, brought more creative livelyhood to the space of work in logic.&#x20;

### Game

The game we played on Friday was designed with kind intention for players to understand how community is formed, and how intensions of each group and individual is influencing the concequences of a co-creation.&#x20;

I realized myself has a visionary aspect, and sometimes cannot fully engage in playing games. I like to analyze the whole game and visualizingn a abstract perspective. Sometimes I do this too much, and I try to balance the visionary part with a little more engagement.&#x20;

In my opinion, community also need to be choosen wisely. During the past years, I had been joining various community back home and flowing around within different communities, and still don't quite find a community that I truly feel safe with and belonged to. Everything just formed and faded in a way that provoked me to question that what is a community? And is community a temporary illusion that is necessary for us to bond and feel safe in the world for a period of time?
